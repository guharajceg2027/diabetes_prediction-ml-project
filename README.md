# Diabetes Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical and demographic features. The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic health condition, and early detection is crucial. This model uses a logistic regression classifier to determine the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on key attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, and other health metrics.

The notebook provided (`diabetes_pred.ipynb`) contains all stages of implementation:

- Importing and understanding the dataset
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a logistic regression model
- Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Files Included

- `diabetes_pred.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and explanation
- `diabetes.xlsx`: Primary dataset used for training and testing
- `diabetesclean.xlsx`: Supplementary or evaluation dataset (optional)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Ensure both `.xlsx` files are in the same directory as the notebook
4. Run the cells sequentially

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib

## Output Metrics

- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)

## Usage

This project is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes. It can serve as a reference for beginners learning about supervised machine learning, especially logistic regression and binary classification problems.
